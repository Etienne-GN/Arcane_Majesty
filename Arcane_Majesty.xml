						<Lyrics>[Verse 1]
	In the shadow of the night, where the stars refuse to glow,
	A kingdom forged in darkness, where the ancient whispers flow.
	Rising from the ashes of a world that once was bright,
	A symphony of silence in the everlasting night.

	[Pre-Chorus]
	Beyond the edge of time and space, where legends dare to dream,
	A force beyond imagining, where nothing’s what it seems.

	[Chorus]
	In the Empire of the Void, where shadows reign supreme,
	We’re bound by chains of destiny, within this dark regime.
	A realm where echoes linger, where silence speaks in screams,
	In the Empire of the Void, we live within our dreams.

	[Verse 2]
	Eclipsing suns and galaxies, our power knows no bounds,
	Eternal night embraces all, in darkness, we are crowned.
	Through cosmic storms and nebulas, our legions march as one,
	An empire built on silence, beneath a blackened sun.

	[Pre-Chorus]
	Beyond the edge of time and space, where legends dare to dream,
	A force beyond imagining, where nothing’s what it seems.

	[Chorus]
	In the Empire of the Void, where shadows reign supreme,
	We’re bound by chains of destiny, within this dark regime.
	A realm where echoes linger, where silence speaks in screams,
	In the Empire of the Void, we live within our dreams.

	[Bridge]
	Through the endless dark, we rise, our spirits never fade,
	In the heart of nothingness, our legacy is made.
	We conquer through the silence, our banners waving high,
	In the Empire of the Void, where stars go to die.

	[Chorus]
	In the Empire of the Void, where shadows reign supreme,
	We’re bound by chains of destiny, within this dark regime.
	A realm where echoes linger, where silence speaks in screams,
	In the Empire of the Void, we live within our dreams.

	[Verse 3]
	As the final light extinguishes, we embrace the endless night,
	In the Empire of the Void, we find our strength and might.
	Through the silence, we are rulers, in the darkness, we are free,
	In the Empire of the Void, our reign will ever be.

	[Outro]
	Through the endless dark, we rise, our spirits never fade,
	In the heart of nothingness, our legacy is made.
	We conquer through the silence, our banners waving high,
	In the Empire of the Void, where stars go to die.</Lyrics>

	The winter has been long and cold
	The frozen land has lost its soul
	But I still remember your warm embrace
	The fire in your eyes, the smile on your face

Claims the throne, but the kingdom’s torn apart.

Brought the Lord of Shadows, to his low. 
But the cost of power, a heavy toll, 
Left the kingdom fractured, and hearts with holes.

Fall of the Lord, the realm in disarray, 
Victory’s price, in the light of day. 
With a crown of sorrow, she takes her place,

Amidst the chaos, a queen stands tall, 
With the weight of loss, she bears it all. 
Her people look to her, for hope and light, 
In the aftermath, she leads the fight.

Rebuilds her kingdom, with a vision true.

Cunning hands that pull the strings unseen.

Each whisper a promise, a vow to reclaim
From the Carnage Queen's grip, etch Nythoria's name

He gathers the remnants, a kingdom's lost fate
Each whisper a promise, a fire renewed
From the shadows they'll rise, vengeance pursued</Lyrics>

In the silence of the night, they gather once again,
Shadows move like whispers, plotting in the den.
Malakar stands tall, eyes burning with his rage,
His loyal few beside him, preparing for the stage.

[Pre-Chorus]
A broken empire, but the fire still burns bright,
In the heart of vengeance, they rise to claim the night.

[Chorus]
The Council calls in secret, their hands weave the plan,
A dark rebirth is rising to take back what they can.
With every whisper, every strike, their power grows anew,
The Council waits in silence, for the day they will break through.

[Verse 2]
Warriors, assassins, minds that see the threads,
From the darkest corners, the council's power spreads.
Each with a gift, a curse, a skill to hone,
Rebuilding armies, waiting for their throne.

[Pre-Chorus]
They rise from ruin, from ashes left behind,
To strike with fury, united in their mind.

The agents of the dark, with eyes that see the lies,
Weaving webs of treason beneath the midnight skies.
Each hidden blade and silent step a strike unknown,
The council's reach extends, soon it will be shown.

[Verse 4]
From shattered lands they rise, their vengeance tightly wound,
With ancient rites and whispers, they prepare to seize the crown.
Masters of the unseen, they forge the path anew,
The dawn of reckoning waits for them to break through.

The storm is brewing, the horizon fades to black,
They march in silence, preparing to attack.
No mercy in their hearts, no turning from their path,
The Council seeks their vengeance, to unleash their wrath.

A dark rebirth is rising to take back what they can.
With every whisper, every strike, their power grows anew,
The Council waits in silence, for the day they will break through.

The shadows shift, the hour draws near,
Malakar’s voice whispers, "They will know fear."
The Council stands ready, with vengeance in their sight,
To rise from the ashes and reclaim the night.</Lyrics>

Ice-kissed peaks, a barren expanse,
Solitude’s embrace, in a chilling trance.
A heart so heavy, with shadows of doubt,
In the silence, a muted shout.

Chilled emotions, on a rugged face,
In the frost, we find our trace.
A trek so vast, through the tempest’s chase,
Finding comfort, in this empty space.

Frozen tears, on a weathered face,
In the cold, we find our place.
A journey long, through the storm’s embrace,
Seeking solace, in this desolate space.

A battle within, beneath the icy cowl.

In the summit’s hold, we won’t sway.
We won’t sway
We won’t sway
We won’t sway

A melody of love, a second chance.
Through the trials, we’ve found our grace,
In the dawn’s embrace, a warm embrace.

[Bridge]
In the darkest night, we held on tight,
With hope as our guide, we found the light.
Now we stand, hand in hand,
In the dawn’s embrace, a promised land.

[Chorus]
Dawn’s embrace, a new beginning,
In the light, our hearts are singing.
With hope’s flame, we’ll find our way,
A brighter tomorrow, starts today.

[Verse 4]
Mountains climbed, and rivers crossed,
In the dawn’s light, no path is lost.
A journey shared, a tale retold,
In the dawn’s embrace, a heart of gold.

[Outro]
Light conquers dark, a world reborn,
Healing winds, a gentle touch.
Hope’s banner, flying high,
A new era dawns, a brighter day.</Lyrics>

Once a man, I walked the earth, a soul untamed
Now a beast, by darkness claimed, forever maimed
A creature of shadows, a feral heart
Torn from humanity, a painful start

[Chorus]
A howl of despair, echoes through the night
A tormented spirit, lost in the fight
Claws and teeth, my only defense

Driven by instinct, a wild control
The moon my guide, a silvered path
Trapped in this nightmare, a bitter offense

Humanity fading, swallowed by the night
A battle rages, within my core
Trapped in this nightmare of darkness, forevermore

I crave the blood, a primal thirst
A savage hunger, a deadly curse
Haunted by memories, a fading light
Lost in the shadows, a endless night

Claws and teeth, my only defense

I yearn for freedom, a chance to be free
To escape this madness, set my spirit free
To find redemption, a glimmer of hope
To break these chains, and leave the scope

A howl of despair, echoes through the night
A tormented spirit, lost in the fight
Claws and teeth, my only defense
A cursed existence, a bitter offense

In the shadows, a pact was made
A sinister bond, in darkness laid.
Two forces met, with evil intent,
A chilling night, where shadows bent.

[Verse 1]
I remember the storm, the plot so vile
A deadly alliance, hidden all the while.
Power was their thirst, a relentless chase
In this dangerous game, none could keep pace.

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust was betrayed, vows were broken
An angel fell, with words unspoken.
A pact was sealed, a choice so fateful
Destiny turned tragic, voices hateful.

[Chorus]
This alliance, dangerous and grim
A game of death, where shadows swim.
A land engulfed in fear, a haunting dread
Darkness spread, as souls were bled.

[Verse 2, haunting, clean vocals]
In the ruins, whispers of the past
Echoes of a time, that couldn’t last.
Shadows danced, in the moon’s pale light
A tale of woe, in the shadows bent.

Titans clashed, in a fight so grand
Battling for dominance, across the land.
Souls were at stake, in cosmic strife
Survival was the goal to know

Trust was betrayed, vows were broken
An angel fell, with words unspoken.
A pact was sealed, a choice so fateful
Destiny turned tragic, voices hateful.

This alliance, dangerous and grim
A game of death, where shadows swim.
A land engulfed in fear, a haunting dread
Darkness spread, as souls were bled.

Betrayal’s mark, on every face
A twisted game, in a darkened place.
Heroes fell, and villains rose
In this deadly dance, no one knows.

The alliance broke, dreams were shattered
Hope faded, screams were scattered.
In the end, only echoes remain
Of a dangerous pact, and a world in pain

Betrayal’s mark, on every face
A twisted game, in a darkened place.
A land engulfed in fear, a haunting dread
Darkness spread, as souls were bled.

In the quiet of the night, Kael and Anya stood apart,
Their hearts heavy with the weight of unspoken words.
Shadows danced around them, whispering tales of love and loss,
A love once bright, now feeling the cost.

[Verse 1]
Kael remembered the first time he saw Anya’s face,
Her eyes filled with dreams, her smile a warm embrace.
But now those dreams seemed distant, the smile a mere memory,
Caught in a storm, waves pulling them to the sea.

[Verse 2]
Anya felt the burden, choices like daggers to her heart,
Longing for simpler days, now every step a painful start.
Warriors in a battle they never wished to fight,
Their love the only shield in the encroaching night.

[Verse 3]
Their love was under siege, a fortress battered by fate,
In the chaos, they clung, desperate to navigate.
Fighting not just for themselves, but for a future bright and free,
A promise of tomorrow, where their hearts could truly be.

[Verse 4]
In a moment of clarity, Kael took Anya’s hand,
Vowing to face the storm, together they would stand.
Hope flickered like a candle, fragile yet bright,
A vow to rebuild, to hold on tight.

As dawn broke, the first rays touched their faces,
A new beginning, a love that embraces.
Their love, though tested, had endured the fight,
Walking forward, hand in hand, into the light.</Lyrics>

In the darkest hour, where fires burn

			  		<Plot>In the primordial mists of time, when the world was young and wild, a group of extraordinary beings emerged from the darkness. They were vampires, ancient and powerful, their origins shrouded in myth and legend. Their eyes, like twin moons, reflected the eternal night, and their skin, pale as moonlight, seemed to glow with an otherworldly light. These vampires were not like the creatures of folklore. They were not driven by a thirst for blood alone, but by a deeper, more ancient hunger. They sought power, knowledge, and dominion over the world. Their existence was a secret, known only to a select few who dared to venture into the forbidden realms.
			  		</Plot>
			  		<Lyrics>[Verse 1]
From the mists of time, they emerged
Ancient beings, their power surged
Eyes like moons, a chilling sight
In the darkness, they found their might

[Chorus]
Crimson Covenant, a name to fear
Their blood runs deep, their hearts austere
Bound by darkness, a primal creed
Seeking power, a wicked seed

[Verse 2]
Pale as moonlight, their skin did glow
A secret world, they dared to know
In shadows lurking, their presence felt
A chilling tale, that would be knelt

[Chorus]
Crimson Covenant, a name to fear
Their blood runs deep, their hearts austere
Bound by darkness, a primal creed
Seeking power, a wicked seed

[Verse 3]
Through centuries they've walked the earth
Their legend grows, their power's worth
A tale of darkness, a haunting song
Of ancient beings, ever strong

[Chorus]
Crimson Covenant, a name to fear
Their blood runs deep, their hearts austere
Bound by darkness, a primal creed
Seeking power, a wicked seed

[Verse 4]
In ancient rituals, they found their might

A covenant forged, a secret pact
Their power unleashed, a chilling fact

Through ages they've wandered, unseen and unknown
Their legacy lingers, a haunting tone
A tale of darkness, a chilling fear
The Crimson Covenant, forever near

Crimson Covenant, a name to fear
Their blood runs deep, their hearts austere
Bound by darkness, a primal creed
Seeking power, a wicked seed

Their legacy etched, in ancient lore
The Crimson Covenant, forevermore

			  		<Plot>In a desolate, forgotten realm, far from the prying eyes of mortals, the vampires gathered. Their meeting place was a cavernous chamber, filled with the echoing drip of water and the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi. Here, they formed a sacred pact, pledging their power and loyalty to a new order. The leader of this gathering was an ancient vampire named Acheron, whose vision and charisma united the disparate clans. The pact was sealed with a solemn oath, spoken in a language as ancient as the stars themselves. They vowed to protect one another, to share their knowledge, and to seek eternal dominion. And so, the Crimson Covenant was born.

			  		<Plot>To strengthen their bond and unlock their full potential, the vampires performed a dark and ancient ritual. They gathered in a secluded grove, beneath a canopy of ancient trees. As the moon reached its zenith, they drew a circle of blood on the forest floor. Into this circle, they poured the blood of their ancestors, a precious and potent substance that contained the essence of their lineage. As the blood flowed, they chanted a powerful incantation, invoking the primal forces of the universe. The ritual was a test of their will and their connection to the ancient bloodline. Those who failed were cast out, their fate sealed.
